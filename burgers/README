A demonstration of different upwind methods of discretizing Burger's equation.

Conservative differencing:

        unew(i) = u(i) - cfl*(0.5*u(i)*u(i) - 0.5*u(i-1)*u(i-1))

gives the correct shock speed, whereas non-conservative differencing:

        unew(i) = u(i) - cfl*u(i)*(u(i) - u(i-1))

gives a slower shock speed.
